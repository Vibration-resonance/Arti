   - Promotional images (440x280, 920x680, 1400x560)
   - Detailed description
   - Privacy policy

2. **Code review**:
   - Remove development console.log statements
   - Ensure no test API keys in code
   - Verify all user data is handled securely
   - Test with production Supabase environment

3. **Final testing**:
   - Test on multiple websites
   - Verify performance on slow connections
